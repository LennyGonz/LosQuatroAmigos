Online Restaurant and Delivery System

In this system, we are about to develop an on-line restaurant order and delivery system so that
the restaurant can provide menus of food, customers browse and order the food from the menu,
delivery people of the restaurant deliver the food with optimal route.
In this system, there are three groups of users:

1. Restaurant:
a) at least two chefs who decide the menus, they may share the same menu for
customers to choose from;
b) at least two delivery people who decide the best route for food delivery
c) the manager who process customer registrations, handles customer compliments
and complaints, hire/fire/promote/demote chef(s)

2. Customers:
a) Registered customers who can browse/search, order and grade (lowest 1 star to
highest 5 stars) food delivered (on food and delivery quality individually).
b) VIP customers who spent more than $500 or placed 50 orders as registered
customers, whichever comes first, in addition to the actions of registered
customers, they will receive 10% discount of their orders and their
complaints/compliments are counted twice as important as ordinary ones.

3. Surfers: who can browse the menus and ratings only, can apply to be the registered
customers with fixed amount of deposit money and certified by the manager.
